# Perutz MS Facility - Protein Contaminants Repository

Welcome to the **Protein Contaminants Repository** of the Max Perutz Labs MS Facility. In mass spectrometry experiments, it's crucial to account for potential contaminants that may interfere with accurate protein identification. This repository is dedicated to managing and versioning our custom FASTA contaminants file that we use in our facility service.

## About the contaminants FASTA file

To ensure compatibility with a wide range of bioinformatics software, the contaminants FASTA file should only contain UniProtKB entries or entries have to adhere to the UniProtKB format, which is outlined in detail onÂ [uniprot.org](https://www.uniprot.org/help/fasta-headers).

The UniProtKB format is specified as follows:

> \>db|UniqueIdentifier|EntryName ProteinName OS=OrganismName OX=OrganismIdentifier GN=GeneName PE=ProteinExistence SV=SequenceVersion

For custom protein entries not present in the UniProt database, such as protein tags, engineered proteins, or synthetic constructs, a specific convention is followed. The `db` field is set as "xx," `OrganismName` is designated as "Synthetic," and `OrganismIdentifier` is specified as "0000." Moreover, special care should be taken to ensure that the `UniqueIdentifier` does not overlap with any existing UniProt Accession number.

## Repository Structure

- **/archive:** This directory contains previous versions of the contaminants file.
- **contaminants_YYYY_NN.fasta:** The main contaminants file used in current projects of the MS facility. The file is named according to the convention `contaminants_YEAR_NUMBER.fasta`, where YEAR represents the current year, and NUMBER is a running index with two digits reset to 1 each year. The UniProt `UniqueIdentifiers` of FASTA entries are prefixed with **contam_** to indicate that they originate from a contaminants FASTA file.
    - For example, `>sp|P13646|K1C13_HUMAN` becomes `>sp|contam_P13646|K1C13_HUMAN`.
- **contaminants_notag_YYYY_NN.fasta:** Identical to the main contaminants file, with the sole distinction that the `UniqueIdentifier` of each entry is not prefixed with the **contam_** tag.

## Changelog
